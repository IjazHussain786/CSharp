This is a simple 2D Role Playing Game. You have health and damage, and so do your enemies. 
Your damage property can be boosted by certain weapons (dispersed on the 2D map). 
If you find and equip yourself with armor you get a defensive bonus. 

There are two types of potions on the map*
-health potion (with different sizes and health bonus) - restores the player's decreased health;
-health bonus potion - boosts the player's health property value permanently;
*potions cannot be consumed during combat.

The game objective is to kill all enemies on the map.

Combat is automatic - when you reach an enemy, you fight until one of you is dead.
